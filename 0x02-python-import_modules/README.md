x02. Python - import & modules

Modules If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable name. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called fibo.py in the current directory with the following contents

Fibonacci numbers module
def fib(n): # write Fibonacci series up to n

   a, b = 0, 1

   while a < n:

       print(a, end=' ')

            a, b = b, a+b

              print()
def fib2(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n

  result = []

       a, b = 0, 1
while a < n:

   result.append(a)

      a, b = b, a+b

   return result
Example 1

fibo.fib(1000)

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987

fibo.fib2(100)

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

fibo.name

'fibo'
