HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
Many applications are running concurrently over the Web, such as web browsing/surfing, e-mail, file transfer, audio & video streaming, and so on. In order
for proper communication to take place between the client and the server, these applications must agree on a specific application-level protocol such as HTT
P, FTP, SMTP, POP, and etc.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is an asymmetric request-response client-server protocol as illustrated.An HTTP client sends a request message to an HTTP server. The server, in tur
n,returns a response message. In other words, HTTP is a pull protocol, the client pulls information from the server (instead of server pushes information d
own to the client).

HTTP is a stateless protocol. In other words, the current request does not know what has been done in the previous requests.

HTTP permits negotiating of data type and representation, so as to allow systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.

HTTP Protocol
As mentioned, whenever you enter a URL in the address box of the browser, the browser translates the URL into a request message according to the specified p
rotocol; and sends the request message to the server.

For example, the browser translated the URL http://www.nowhere123.com/doc/index.html into the following request message:

       GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
       Host: www.nowhere123.com
       Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
       Accept-Language: en-us
       Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
       User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
